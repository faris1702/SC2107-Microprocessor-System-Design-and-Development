# SC2107 Microprocessor System Design & Development, Computer Engineering AY24S2<<br/>

## Overview of the Labs:
In all 5 labs, you will learn to use Texas Instrument's RSLK Max and interface it using Code Composer in C coding language. The first 4 labs are for learning and practice while the last lab is a test. <br/>
You will learn how to use the sensors and I/Os of the RSLK:<br/>
- Proximity sensor (IR sensor)
- Reflectance sensor (measures how much light reflects from the surface below)
- Bump switches
- LED
- Button

## Recomendations:
- Read up before going for labs. The labs are simple enough to be completed within 1 or 2 sessions (attend free access)
- For the final test, I recommend attend free access as much as possible to do everything possible with the RSLK and its sensor. You should try to implement the following:
    - Line following, use reflectance sensor to follow a black line. Add black lines across the route to make sure it follows the correct line
    - Proximity tests, RSLK travels straight before stopping when close to object (uses IR sensor)
    - Reaction to a bump switch activation, could be LED light up, or 90 degree stationary turn
    - Reaction to a button press
- These will help you have a good understanding of how to interface the RSLK so that you can implement any task easily
